## Project plan

### Project description

Volunteer With IT is a project designed to provide support to those who struggle with their current level of IT skills, especially where that impact on their ability to find employment. Our aim is to help improve the skills of individuals who have little experience with IT to become more involved with technology by providing one to one support with volunteer peer mentors.

We provide a range of commonly used devices for learners including laptops, iPads, and Android tablets. Our learners can use and practice with these to develop their basic digital skills such as using social media to contact family and friends, browsing the web, applying for jobs, or anything else they feel would improve their lives.


## Project milestones

### Milestone 1

Purchasing computer equipment for use by the learners.

### Milestone 2

Recruiting and training a group of volunteer mentors.

### Milestone 3

Group sessions to assess the current level of IT skills of our learners and identify their goals.

### Milestone 4

Matching each learner with a peer mentor.

### Milestone 5
One to one sessions between each learner-mentor pair to achieve their goals.

### Milestone 6
Reassessment of goals after a number of sessions to evaluate how the support is helping learners.
