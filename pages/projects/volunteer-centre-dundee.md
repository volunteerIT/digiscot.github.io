## Project plan

### Project description

Our project is designed to provide support to individuals who have barriers to full participation in society. We aim to help those who identify a lack of basic IT skills as a major hurdle in finding employment or in taking part in day to day activities.

Our concept revolves around involving volunteer IT mentors to engage with participants of the project to identify what their specific needs are, and to design support to enable them to meet their goals. The Volunteer Centre will provide access to the equipment and space that learners will need while being supported by one of our volunteers. 


## Project milestones

### March - May 2015

Our first goal was to recruit a group of volunteer IT mentors who are willing to help participants in the project. In our first round of recruiting we selected seven volunteers each with their own background and level of IT knowledge.

### May 2015

We provided training to our volunteer mentors which enables them to provide the type of one on one support that is needed for our learners. This focussed on helping them to identify what support that they will need and enabling them to meet their goals.

### May - August 2015

During this time we recruited our group of learners. They came from diverse backgrounds and all had their own levels of knowledge coming into the project.

### August 2015

We arranged a group session with our peer mentors and participants to assess their current skills. We helped leaners to identify some specific goals that they would like to meet from the project.

Once the learners had chosen their goals we were able to match each of our mentors with one or two learners.

### August - January 2016

Our volunteers and learners met each other over several sessions. In this time, the mentors show learners how to achieve their goals while working towards increasing their confidence and skills.

### January 2016

We will meet with all of our learners and volunteers as a group again to discuss how the project is going. We will assess how our learners are getting on and whether they feel that they are successfully moving towards their goals.
